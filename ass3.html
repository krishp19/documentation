            <header>User Roles and Permissions</header>
            <article class="main-article">
                <p>User roles and permissions in an online learning platform are pivotal for maintaining security and functionality. Learners, as the primary users, engage in course activities such as accessing materials and participating in discussions. Instructors hold responsibilities for content creation, assessment, and facilitating interactions, requiring permissions to manage courses and grade assignments. Administrators, with elevated privileges, oversee system operations, manage user accounts, configure settings, and enforce security measures. Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures users have appropriate access levels, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions and data breaches while promoting efficient platform management. By clearly defining and managing user roles and permissions, online learning platforms can optimize security, user experience, and administrative efficiency.</p>
                <p>Learners are individuals enrolled in courses within the online learning platform. Their primary role is to participate in educational activities, such as watching lectures, completing assignments, and engaging in discussions</p>
                <p>Instructors are responsible for creating and delivering course content, assessing learner performance, and facilitating interactions within the online learning environment. Their role is crucial in guiding learners through the educational process and providing support as needed. </p>

            <header>Account Security</header>
            <article class="main-article">
                <p>Account security is paramount in ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of user information within an online learning platform. By implementing robust security measures, users can protect their accounts from unauthorized access and safeguard sensitive data.

                    1. Strong Passwords
                    
                    Creating strong, unique passwords is the first line of defense against unauthorized access to user accounts. Encourage users to choose passwords that are complex and difficult to guess, incorporating a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, recommend the use of password managers to securely store and manage passwords for multiple accounts.
                    
                    2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
                    
                    Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide a second form of verification, such as a code sent to their mobile device, in addition to their password. Enable 2FA wherever possible to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, even if passwords are compromised.
                    
                    3. Account Recovery Options
                    
                    Provide users with options for account recovery in case they forget their passwords or lose access to their accounts. This might include email verification, security questions, or backup codes. Ensure that account recovery processes are secure and do not inadvertently expose sensitive information.
                    
                    4. Regular Password Updates
                    
                    Encourage users to regularly update their passwords to reduce the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials. Implement password expiration policies and prompt users to change their passwords periodically.
                    
                    5. Phishing Awareness
                    
                    Educate users about the dangers of phishing attacks, where attackers attempt to trick individuals into disclosing their login credentials or other sensitive information. Teach users how to recognize phishing attempts and verify the authenticity of emails, links, and messages received.
                    
                    By prioritizing account security measures such as strong passwords, two-factor authentication, account recovery options, regular password updates, and phishing awareness, users can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect their accounts within the online learning platform.
